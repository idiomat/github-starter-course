# GITHUB LESSONS :school_satchel:




### Topics I feel comfortable with

* Knowing the difference between Github and Git.
  *   Basically, they are both version control systems, but  Github is a software program that
      that has the open source Git, "under the hood", but offers a user interface for ease of use.

* Cloning a repo
  *   This involves running a "git clone (followed by URL)" command to bring down a local copy of the repo.  This brings down all the branches that exist in that repo
  *   Once this is done, I should create my own branch to keep my code changes seperate from the main code.  I know I can do this via a "git checkout -b nameofmybranch"
 
* Making Commits, pushing and pulling
  *   I currently use Github at work and have had to perform these actions a few times during pairing sessions. I am comfortable with what these commands are, but sometimes, may need to Google the exact command. I know that if I want to push the changes
      that I made in my code to the main branch, I would push the code. Piror to doing that I would need to stage the file via a "git add ." and then add my comments via a  "commit -m"
  *   If I want to make sure I have the latest updates on the remote branch I would perform a "git pull"
